# Bootstrap-sampling
Generate bootstrap samples to compute means and medians, visualize distributions, and evaluate the Central Limit Theorem's role in large sample approximations.
Investigate the effect of outliers on bootstrap estimates by comparing trimmed means, standard errors, and confidence intervals for clean and contaminated datasets.
Utilize both nonparametric and parametric bootstrap methods to estimate bias, standard error, and corrected confidence intervals for the mean and trimmed mean.
Summarize findings in tables and graphs while explaining the methodology for constructing confidence intervals and testing robust estimators.
